The data are taken from a clinical trial of 59 epileptics, who were
randomized to receive either the anti-epileptic drug progabide or a
placebo. The data on each subject consist of a baseline count of the
number of seizures over an eight-week period prior to treatment
allocation, followed by counts in four two-week periods
post-treatment.
