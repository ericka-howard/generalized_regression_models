# COVID-19 Cases in King County, Washington

This repository contains my final project from my Generalized Regression Models course in Fall 2020. The report can be found [here.](https://github.com/erickabsmith/generalized_regression_models/blob/main/doc/COVID-19_Cases_in_King_County_WA.pdf)

In this project I compare Poisson regression with quasi-Poisson Regression and negative binomial regression for overdisperesed count data.
